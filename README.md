# My-XFCE-Rice
My CSS file that I think looks nice!

In order to install this to *your* XFCE desktop, check that you have the config file. For good measure, type

```mkdir .config/gtk-3.0```

If it results in an error stating the directory exists, or no error at all, then you are ready to continue

Enter:

```
cd ~/.config/gtk-3.0
git clone ...
```

Yay! You have installed my theme! Enjoy.
